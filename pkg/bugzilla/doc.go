/*  Package bugzilla implements a basic bugzilla jsonrpc api wrapper with a single query

Create a new Client with the required credentials.  You'll then be able
to call ExecuteQuery with a saved search.  This is based on Red Hat's
Bugzilla - so the saved search feature may not exist for your desired
bugzilla instance.
